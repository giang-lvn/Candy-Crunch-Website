                        <p> &#8226 Optional video showing melting, contamination, crushing, or leakage (helps verify severity and support delivery partner reports).</p>
                        <br /><br />
                        Perishable goods notes:
                        <p> &#8226 Minor softening or shape changes due to heat are not considered damage.</p>
                        <p> &#8226 Severe melting, leakage, contamination, or crushed goods qualify for refund or replacement.</p>
                        <p> &#8226 Candy Crunch uses insulated packaging, but extreme weather may still affect product condition.</p>
